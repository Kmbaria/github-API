# GithubAPI

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.7.

# Project name
Git Search.
# Project description:
> Create a website where users may enter a GitHub username into a form, submit it, and see names and descriptions of that       person's public repositories. A person can also look for repositories.

>  Use the GitHub API (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. to retrieve this information. This API allows        5,000 requests per hour with an API key, but only 60 requests per hour _without_ one. Everyone is therefore required to use    their own unique key. GitHub refers to these keys as "Personal Access Tokens".

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build
